# Homework X: PM/0

## Description
This is a virtual machine designed to follow the instructions of the P-Machine ISA. 
The input is a file with instructions within the specified ISA.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile run,
    gcc vm.c
while in the same directory as vm.c

## Usage
To run with the input file,
    ./a.out <InputFileName>.txt
Replace <InputFileName> with the file name of the instructions

The output, showing the instructions and corresponding stack, PC, and 
SP values after each instruction is shown in the terminal. If 
instruction 9 0 2 is encountered meaning there is user input, you will 
be promted in the terminal, just enter your input and hit enter.

## Example
Running with the test case given (input file is called program.txt in this case)

gcc vm.c
./a.out program.txt 
First few lines of output:
                 PC  BP  SP   Stack
Initial Values:  10  499 500 

JMP  0  85       85  499 500
